There many people who have supported me through this project that I wish to thank.

My house mates, for putting up with me always being huddled over a laptop.
My family, for their continuous love and support.
Nikoleta Glynatsi, for her constant ideas and advice.
And finally, Dr Vince Knight who has shaped my undergraduate degree so much.
I greatly appreciate all of the effort you have put in over the past few years, and I can't thank you enough.
